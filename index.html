                <h2>James Webb's birthday is coming up</h2>
                <p>
                    The launch of the James Webb will be one year old next Christmas. A small time, given the revolution
                    this telescope has already brought to humanity. It is also perhaps NASA's most ambitious project to
                    date, as it is the largest telescope in size and weight currently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparing the more famous Hubble
                    telescope with the James Webb, the big difference between them would be that its younger brother
                    sees in the infrared spectrum, making it possible to capture galaxies and stars 13.5 billion
                    light-years away.</p>

            <h2>Why James Webb's so revolutionary</h2>
            <p>
                Every space telescope observes the "past", since the light emitted by distant stars and planets needs a
                certain amount of time to reach the Earth. For example, when we observe the light from a star located
                1,000
                light years away, we are observing the light that was emitted by the star 1,000 years ago.
                The James Webb can also contribute to surveys of the planets outside our Solar System. The telescope's
                infrared is sensitive to molecules such as water, carbon dioxide, and organic substances, which gives it
                the
                power to see the molecular composition of atmospheres on planets and moons in the Solar System and on
                exoplanets.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to NASA, the telescope consists of four large scientific instruments. The first is the Fine
                Guidance Sensor/Near Infrared Detector and Slit-less Spectrograph. It enables the James Webb to
                have high quality imaging accuracy and is used to investigate first light detection, characterization,
                and
                transit of exoplanets.
                The Mid-Infrared Instrument has a camera and spectrograph that sees light in the mid-infrared region,
                with wavelengths longer than our eyes can see. With its sensitive detectors, it will be possible to see
                red-shifted light from distant galaxies, newly formed stars, and faint comets.
                The Near Infrared Spectrograph is used to scatter light from an object into a spectrum. In this
                way it is possible to discover physical properties such as temperature, mass, and chemical composition
                of an
                object. This instrument is designed to observe 100 objects simultaneously and is the first spectrograph
                in
                space with this capability.
                Finally, the Near Infrared Camera is the telescope's main imaging camera. It will detect light from
                early stars and galaxies in the process of formation, as well as stars in nearby galaxies.
                The NIRCam has coronagraphs, i.e. instruments that block the light from a brighter object, making it
                possible to photograph darker objects nearby.

                    <p>
                        Called the Cosmic Cliffs, the region is actually the edge of a gigantic, gaseous cavity within
                        NGC 3324, roughly 7,600 light-years away. The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by
                        the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars
                        located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image. The high-energy
                        radiation from these stars is sculpting the nebula's wall by slowly eroding it away.

                    <p>
                        Over thousands of years and before it became a white dwarf, the star periodically ejected mass
                        the visible shells of material. As if on repeat, it contracted, heated up and then, unable to
                        push out more material, pulsated. Stellar material was sent in all directions like a rotating
                        sprinkler and provided the ingredients for this asymmetrical landscape.
                        Today, the white dwarf is heating up the gas in the inner regions which appear blue at left
                        and red at right. Both stars are lighting up the outer regions, shown in orange and blue,
                        respectively.

                    <h3>3 - Webb's First Deep Field</h3>
                    <p>
                        First, focus on the galaxies responsible for the lensing: the bright white elliptical galaxy at
                        the center of the image and smaller white galaxies throughout the image. Bound together by
                        gravity in a galaxy cluster, they are bending the light from galaxies that appear in the vast
                        distances behind them. The combined mass of the galaxies and dark matter act as a cosmic
                        telescope, creating magnified, contorted, and sometimes mirrored images of individual galaxies.
